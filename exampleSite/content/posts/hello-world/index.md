Welcome to Soberano — a dark, monospace, cypherpunk-inspired Hugo theme for sovereign digital publishing.

This is an example post to showcase the theme's typography and layout. The theme is designed around a few core principles:

## Privacy First

No external tracking. No analytics. Self-hosted fonts. Your site, your rules.

## Minimal by Design

Pure CSS, minimal JavaScript, zero frameworks. Fast builds, fast pages.

## Configurable

Everything is driven by `hugo.toml` — menus, hero content, social links, footer. No hardcoded content in the templates.

Sovereignty begins with owning your own publishing infrastructure.
