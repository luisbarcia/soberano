## Why Crypto Only?

This site is about digital sovereignty. Accepting PayPal (freezes accounts arbitrarily), credit cards (full tracking), or any state-controlled payment method would be inconsistent with everything written here.

Bitcoin, Lightning, and Monero are money that doesn't ask permission. No intermediary can censor the transaction, freeze the funds, or report who sent them.

If you've never used Bitcoin, this might be a good first reason to start.
